## Task One
- Having worked off the Dawn theme before, I knew it already had a default carousel called 'Featured Collection' which can be a good starting point for this project.
- It also has it's own 'Add to Cart' button.
- I tried to keep as much as the Dawn settings from the 'Featured Collection' section as possible, adding in my own settings / styles to make the carousel look like the brief.
- I copied over a lot of the font, colours, spacing settings from the design mockup.

## Task Two
- Because I used Dawn's default to complete the 'Add to Cart' CTA, I had some extra time to play with.
- I created another Carousel section with a third party js library called 'Glide js'. I've used this many times in different projects, and found it quick and easy to setup with a cdn link.
- The two sections are identical, while also trying to keep as close to the design as possible.

## Design Notes
- I did notice that the new Carousel section was using different fonts compared to the rest of the design mockup. So I updated all the Heading & Body fonts in the Typography theme settings to match the design. This affected the whole site, but I hope you don't mind.
